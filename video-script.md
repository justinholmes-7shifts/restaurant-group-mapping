# Restaurant Group Mapping Analysis - Video Script
**Duration: 2-3 minutes**

---

## INTRO (0:00-0:20)

**[Visual: Show title slide with "Restaurant Group Mapping Analysis - Miami Market"]**

**Script:**
"Hey everyone, I want to share something exciting I discovered by analyzing our Miami customer base. I took our 267 active Miami restaurant locations and mapped out which ones belong to larger restaurant groups. What I found revealed some massive expansion opportunities hiding in plain sight."

## THE APPROACH (0:20-0:45)

**[Visual: Show workflow diagram or screenshot of data/analysis files]**

**Script:**
"Here's what I did: I analyzed each restaurant's website, social media, and public records to identify parent companies and sister restaurants. I looked for corporate structures, shared ownership, and multi-location operations.

Important note on data security: For any analysis involving PII data, we use Gemini CLI to ensure compliance with our security policies. If you're ever uncertain whether data qualifies as PII, reach out to the security team first.

The goal was simple: understand our market penetration within existing customers and find white space opportunities where we already have a foot in the door."

## KEY FINDING #1: MARKET STRUCTURE (0:45-1:15)

**[Visual: Show pie chart - 67% groups vs 33% independent]**

**Script:**
"First major finding: 67% of our Miami customers - that's 180 restaurants - belong to restaurant groups. We identified 35+ different groups.

But here's what's interesting: these break down into two types.

**[Visual: Show comparison - Multi-concept vs Single-brand]**

Fifteen groups are multi-concept operators - they run completely different restaurant brands under one umbrella. Think Ariete Hospitality Group with 10+ distinct concepts from Michelin-starred fine dining to casual diners.

The other twenty are single-brand chains - like Sushi Sake with 30+ locations, all with the same name and menu.

This matters because they have different needs and different sales approaches."

## KEY FINDING #2: WHITE SPACE WITHIN CUSTOMERS (1:15-1:45)

**[Visual: Show top expansion targets with penetration percentages]**

**Script:**
"Here's where it gets really interesting. Many of these groups have WAY more locations than what we're seeing in our Miami data.

For example:
- Sushi Sake operates 30+ locations - we have 13 of them. That's 17 locations we don't have yet.
- Ariete Hospitality runs 10+ concepts - we only have 3.
- Groot Hospitality has 10+ venues - we have 2.

In total, I found 48 to 63 locations within our EXISTING customer groups that we haven't captured yet. These are warm leads because we already have relationships with their sister locations."

---

## KEY FINDING #3: MULTI-STATE OPPORTUNITY (1:45-2:15)

**[Visual: Show US map with highlighted states and location counts]**

**Script:**
"But the biggest opportunity? Going multi-state.

I found 11 of our Miami customer groups operate locations in other states. And I'm not talking about a few locations - I'm talking about 900 to 1,000+ total locations across 40+ states.

**[Visual: Show top multi-state operators list]**

The biggest ones:
- Nothing Bundt Cakes: 694 locations in 43 states
- Pura Vida: 50+ locations across Florida, New York, and California - we have 9 in Miami
- bartaco: 30 locations in 16 states - we have 1
- Salt & Straw: 40 locations in 7 states - we have 2

These are existing customers. We already proved value in one market. Now we can expand the relationship."

---

## ACTION ITEMS (2:15-2:35)

**[Visual: Show prioritized action plan]**

**Script:**
"So what's next?

Priority 1: Start with the white space - call Sushi Sake, Ariete, and Groot about their other Miami locations.

Priority 2: Expand with our strongest relationships - Pura Vida has 50+ locations and we've already proven value with 9 of them.

Priority 3: Target corporate-owned multi-state operators like bartaco and Salt & Straw where one decision-maker can roll out to 30-40 locations.

All the detailed analysis, location counts, and contact strategies are documented in the repository."

## CLOSING (2:35-2:50)

**[Visual: Show repository structure or summary stats]**

**Script:**
"Bottom line: We have 267 Miami customers, but the real opportunity is 1,000+ locations when you include white space and multi-state expansion - all within existing customer relationships.

Happy to answer any questions and share the detailed analysis with anyone who wants to dig deeper. Thanks!"
