**Analysis Date:** November 25, 2024
**Current 7shifts Customers in Dataset:** 267 active locations
**Market:** Miami, FL

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT CAVEATS & LIMITATIONS

### Data Limitations:

1. **Your Dataset = Complete Picture of Active Customers**
   - Dataset shows 267 active 7shifts customer locations
   - Analysis assumes this represents ALL your Miami customers
   - ❓ **Caveat:** If you have customers NOT in this dataset, counts would be different

2. **Web Research Data Currency**
   - Location counts for groups (e.g., "30+ Sushi Sake locations") are from web searches conducted Nov 25, 2024
   - Restaurant group websites may not be current
   - Some websites don't list all locations
   - ❓ **Caveat:** Actual location counts may differ from what's published online

3. **SKINNY LOUIE Expansion Timeline UNCERTAIN**
   - Multiple articles mention expansion plans (Coral Gables, Aventura, West Palm, etc.)
   - Articles found show future dates (2025) but publication dates unclear
   - Cannot confirm which locations are actually under construction vs planned vs already open
   - ❓ **Caveat:** "10+ locations opening" claim is based on uncorroborated web articles
   - ✅ **Action Required:** Call SKINNY LOUIE directly to confirm current expansion status

4. **White Space Calculations Are Estimates**
   - "38-48 white space locations" assumes web-researched location counts are accurate
   - Does not account for:
     - Closed locations not yet removed from websites
     - Franchise vs corporate ownership differences
     - Locations that may already be 7shifts customers but not in this dataset
   - ❓ **Caveat:** True white space may be higher or lower

5. **Penetration Percentages Based on Public Information**
   - Example: "Sushi Sake Corporate: 43% penetration (13 of 30+)"
   - "30+" is from their website's locations page
   - May include franchises, ghost kitchens, or closed locations
   - ❓ **Caveat:** Actual penetration percentage could vary

6. **Multi-Market Expansion Not Verified**
   - Claims about groups expanding to Dallas, Las Vegas, NYC based on web articles
   - Timeline and actual opening dates not confirmed
   - ❓ **Caveat:** Expansion plans may have changed or been delayed

### Recommendations for Data Validation:

**Before acting on this analysis:**
1. ✅ **Call restaurant groups directly** to confirm total location counts
2. ✅ **Verify expansion timelines** with direct contacts (especially SKINNY LOUIE)
3. ✅ **Cross-reference your internal CRM** to ensure dataset completeness
4. ✅ **Check for franchise relationships** (some "group" locations may be independent franchises)
5. ✅ **Validate white space** isn't already served by regional/enterprise agreements

## Competitive Intelligence Questions

To refine this analysis further:

1. **Are competitors present at the uncaptured locations?**
   - Do the other 17 Sushi Sake locations use a competitor?
   - Or do they use manual/legacy systems?

2. **Why partial penetration?**
   - Technical reasons (different POS systems at some locations?)
   - Different franchisees/ownership at some locations?
   - Legacy contracts at some locations?

3. **Expansion timing:**
   - When do the Sushi Sake contracts renew at non-7shifts locations?
   - What's the timeline for SKINNY LOUIE's 10+ new openings?
   - When is Groot opening Dallas/Vegas locations?

Understanding WHY you have partial penetration will inform the expansion strategy!
