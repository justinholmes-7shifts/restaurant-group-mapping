## Competitive Intelligence Questions

To refine this analysis further:

1. **Are competitors present at the uncaptured locations?**
   - Do the other 17 Sushi Sake locations use a competitor?
   - Or do they use manual/legacy systems?

2. **Why partial penetration?**
   - Technical reasons (different POS systems at some locations?)
   - Different franchisees/ownership at some locations?
   - Legacy contracts at some locations?

3. **Expansion timing:**
   - When do the Sushi Sake contracts renew at non-7shifts locations?
   - What's the timeline for SKINNY LOUIE's 10+ new openings?
   - When is Groot opening Dallas/Vegas locations?

Understanding WHY you have partial penetration will inform the expansion strategy!
